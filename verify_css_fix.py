🔧 PROBLEM:
The original CSS rule '.problem-card.active p' affected ALL <p> elements 
inside an active problem card, including those in the solution preview.
This caused the solution text to become faded (opacity 0.4) when it should 
remain fully visible.

🔧 SOLUTION:
1. Changed '.problem-card.active p' to '.problem-card.active > p'
   - The '>' selector only targets DIRECT children
   - This means only the problem description <p> gets faded
   - The solution preview <p> elements are NOT direct children, so they're unaffected

2. Added 'opacity: 1' to '.solution-preview p'
   - This explicitly ensures solution text remains fully opaque
   - Overrides any potential inheritance issues
   - Guarantees white text visibility

🎯 RESULT:
- Problem description fades when card is active (as intended)
- Solution text remains fully visible and white (as intended)
- CSS inheritance issue resolved
